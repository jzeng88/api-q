API-Q is an application for sending and receiving HTTP requests and notably, scheduling the sending of a request at a later time (hence the name, API-"queue"). This saves the developer time and hassle from having to setup their own server to receive a response. API-Q is sort of like a slimmed down and easier to use version of Postman, but with a scheduler.
